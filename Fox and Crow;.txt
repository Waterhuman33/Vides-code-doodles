Fox and Crow;
Keep both Fox and Crow happy and set on the same goal. 

Sometimes the Crow throws a hissy fit
Sometimes the Fox refuses to help


Help them trick each other to keep both motivated.
Help them get to their respective but in the end shared goal.
(Maybe the goal was the friendship we made along the way?) but they still go their own way. Memories can be good and they are allowed to be just that, memories.
