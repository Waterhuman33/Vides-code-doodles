Take flight;

you are a philantropic postman in the midevial times

you need to manage postal birds, they can fly away just well, but when returning they will fly around all lost until you reel them back in.

none of the letters are marked and you decide who gets what letter.

Experience funny errors and missed communication.

get bonus point for correct deliveries but maybe you can salvage a situation that started as a mistake.


YOU GET ENJOYMENT WHEN PEOPLE GET HAPPY
